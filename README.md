# WorldStage

> All the world's a stage,\
> And all the men and women merely players;\
> They have their exits and their entrances

The WorldStage is designed to tune a foundation model into a player on the real world stage. It can be your daughter's digital pet, your car assistant, and your housekeeper.

We found three most important aspects to make a good player: 1) **self-identification**, 2) **personality**, 3) **ability** to interact with the world.
